## CNS359 - Build, deploy, and operate agentic architectures on AWS Serverless
AWS re:Invent 2025

### Session Type
Breakout Session

### Abstract
Discover how to architect scalable, production-ready agentic AI applications on AWS that deliver autonomous, multi-agent solutions for complex business challenges. Many organizations struggle with designing AI agents for real-world complexity, from managing context effectively to ensuring secure, scalable deployments. This session covers proven architectural patterns for single and multi-agent systems, applying monolith-to-microservices principles and domain-driven design to avoid common pitfalls. You'll explore practical implementations using API Gateway, Lambda, Fargate, and AgentCore Runtime with security best practices. Join us to transform your agentic AI understanding from experimental prototypes to production-ready systems.
