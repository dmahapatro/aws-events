## CNS428 - Implementing Human-in-the-loop controls for multi-agent AI systems
AWS re:Invent 2025

### Session Type
Lightning Talk

### Abstract
While AI agents offer powerful automation capabilities, many critical business workflows require human oversight and approval. This 20-minute lightning talk demonstrates practical patterns for integrating human-in-the-loop (HITL) controls within multi-agent AI systems. Learn how to design asynchronous agent workflows that incorporate human decision points using serverless architectures. We'll explore real-world examples showing when and how to implement HITL effectively while maintaining system reliability and scalability. Walk away with actionable patterns for building AI agent systems that balance automation with appropriate human oversight.
